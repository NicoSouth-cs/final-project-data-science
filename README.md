this code and database is designed to create graphs to showcase links between different factors leading to alzheimers or dementia involved symptoms.
this code is run by placing the main data file in your google drive, loading the code and running it through colab


findings: i found that there were links to infarction rates seen when you use years of education or age as a base for comparison. these were two of the strongest factors in my research to find links to alzheimers and/or dementia seen in individuals that were examined


Big areas of focus:
* microinfarctions in the brain found
* years of education
* age at death

the data involved showed a highest rate of connection with age to infarctions. infarctions are a good source of data in this case to relate to alzheimers as infarctions show the state of brain health and decay
